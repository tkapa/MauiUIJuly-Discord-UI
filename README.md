# MauiUIJuly-Discord-UI

Headed by my colleague [Matt Goldman](https://mobile.twitter.com/mattgoldman), [#MauiUIJuly](https://goforgoldman.com/2022/05/19/maui-ui-july.html) is a month long celebration off all (UI) things Maui!

As a beginner to Maui myself, I've taken on a pretty big challenge of replicating the UI for an app that I use daily, [Discord](https://discord.com/)!

Take a look [here](https://goforgoldman.com/2022/05/19/maui-ui-july.html) to see the amazing things everyone else participating has created. 

Come back here when we take a look at how I accomplished what I did.
